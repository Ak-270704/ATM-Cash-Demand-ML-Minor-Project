Project Title: ATM Cash Demand Forecast for BankServe

Description:

BankServe aims to optimize its ATM network operations and enhance customer satisfaction by implementing a data-driven "ATM Cash Demand Forecast" system. This project focuses on developing a predictive model that accurately forecasts the cash demand at various ATM locations. The model will consider factors such as historical withdrawal data, seasonality, local events, demographic information, and economic indicators. By providing reliable cash demand forecasts, the system will empower BankServe to optimize cash replenishment schedules, minimize ATM downtime due to cash shortages, reduce operational costs associated with excessive cash holdings, and ultimately enhance the efficiency and profitability of its ATM network.

Guidelines:

- Build a predictive model to forecast cash demand at ATM locations accurately.
- Analyze factors such as historical withdrawal data, seasonality, local events, demographic information, and economic indicators.
- Develop a clear dashboard or report to present cash demand forecasts and replenishment schedules.
- Ensure the model is robust and adaptable to varying ATM networks and usage patterns.
